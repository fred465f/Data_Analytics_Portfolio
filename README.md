## Data Analytics Portfolio - Frederik Rytter

# [Project 1: Analysis of factors that affect test results](https://github.com/fred465f/exams)
In this project I analyse a dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about three different categories of tests, reading, writing and math. I focus on what factors, such as parental education level, gender and test preperation, that affects how well a student does on the test.

Correlation between the above factors will be analysed. I will furthermore examine whether there is a significant difference betweem test results from the general population and that of the students that participated in the test preperation. I will also examine whether there is a significant difference betweem test results of students whos parents have different educational background. The last thing i will examine is whether a student that does well in one test, also does well on the other tests.

# [Project 2: Lab - Data Analytics Module](https://github.com/fred465f/Lab)
Lab is a small module for python data analysis, made with the purpose of easing
the workflow of analysing data, to get a quick overview of the most important aspects of the data at hand.
It contains features such as,

 - Easy acces to different analysis types
 - Fitting data to models and visualise residuals
 - Clean data for missing values and inconvertable values
 - Keeping af log of events in the analysis progress

All made with the purpose of creating an simple and quick workflow for getting a quick overview of the data.
