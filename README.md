## Data Analytics Portfolio - Frederik Rytter

# [Project 1: Analysis of factors that affect test results](https://github.com/fred465f/exams)
In this project I analyse a dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about three different categories of tests, reading, writing and math. I focus on what factors, such as parental education level, gender and test preperation, that affects how well a student does on the test.

Correlation between the above factors will be analysed. I will furthermore examine whether there is a significant difference betweem test results from the general population and that of the students that participated in the test preperation. I will also examine whether there is a significant difference betweem test results of students whos parents have different educational background. The last thing i will examine is whether a student that does well in one test, also does well on the other tests.

# [Project 2: Lab - Data Analytics Module](https://github.com/fred465f/Lab)
Lab is a small module for python data analysis, made with the purpose of easing
the workflow of analysing data, to get a quick overview of the most important aspects of the data at hand.
It contains features such as,

 - Easy acces to different analysis types
 - Fitting data to models and visualise residuals
 - Clean data for missing values and inconvertable values
 - Keeping af log of events in the analysis progress

All made with the purpose of creating an simple and quick workflow for getting a quick overview of the data.

# [Airline sentiment analysis](https://github.com/fred465f/Airline_sentiment_repo)

In this project i analysed data regarded Twitter reviews of US Airlines, and used the python libraries:

 - sqlite3
 - seaborn
 - pandas
 - csv

The python library sqlite3 was used to write sqlite commands to query the database, 'database.sqlite', downloaded from kaggle, 
https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment, and originaly collected at Crowdflower's Data for Everyone library. 
Pandas was used to import the tables - that were created by the queries and uploaded with the csv library. 

The number of positive, neutral and negative number of reviews, grouped by each arline were calculated and visualised with seaborn:

The positive/negative sentiment ratio grouped by each arline were calculated and visualised with seaborn:
